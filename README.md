2025 Honors Software Development/Internship Project #2 - Nick Callaghan and Senaiah Butcher

Our final project is an Arduino hardware project that uses a thermistor (a temperature-based resistor) to measure the temperature of the person touching the device. After about 20 seconds, based on their finger temperature, an emotion is displayed on an LCD monitor. Additionally, an RGB LED will show a color associated with the emotion. Kinda like a digital “mood ring”.
